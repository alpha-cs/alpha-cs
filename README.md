About Me:
<p align="left">
Am a software engineer looking to increase my knowledge and continue growing in this field. My account may look new but am not new to github. Ive been in this community
  since highschool and through out my college year. I joined back in 2013 to when I was managing a Minecraft server with over 500 concurrent users at all times.
  I feel that in part of growing as a software engineer we also need to continue building greater things and bigger projects. This github account main purpose is
  to only upload projects am passionate about and projects I want to continue growing. Such as my personal webpage that I do not like what so ever now. I want to
  completly rebuild it. I tent to do this every year.
